# Largest number
Given an array of N non-negative integers, arrange them in such a manner that they form the largest number possible.

Input Format: 
The first line of input consists number of the test cases T. The description of T test cases is as follows:
The first line of each test case contains the size of the array N, and the second line has the elements of the array.

Output Format: 
For each testcase, in a new line, print the largest number formed by arranging the elements of the array.

User Task: 
This is a functional problem. You only have to complete the function findLargestNumber() and return the largest number formed from these numbers. Return type is string.

Constraints: 
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 109
