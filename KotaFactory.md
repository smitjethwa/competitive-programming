In the Prodigy classes, the mathematics teacher has suddenly fallen ill. The class is very important so Jeetu Bhaiya has decided to take the class. Although, he is the best physics teacher in the kota, he decided to take the Mathematics class for a change and also because of the students demand. Jeetu Bhaiya always teach in a different and interesting manner, who can forget the rim experiment. This time too he has decided to bring something interesting to the table. He has brought a few dummies with numbers on them to demonstrate a problem. He goes on to explain the problem to the students. The dummies are divided into two groups and the product of the respective groups is calculated. Out of the different groups, only the groups whose product gcd is 1 are to be picked.

Group 1: {2, 3}; Product = 6; Group 2: {5}; gcd(6, 5) = 1 The problem is to find the number of ways of dividing the dummies into groups such that the gcd of their product is 1. For the given set of dummies, there are 6 ways of dividing them into two groups following the property.

Group 1: {2}; Group 2: {3, 5}
Group 1: {2, 5}; Group 2: {3}
Group 1: {3}; Group 2: {2, 5}
Group 1: {3, 5}; Group 2: {2}
Group 1: {5}; Group 2: {2, 3}
After explaining the problem and demonstrating the way, he tells students that it is a Chocolate Problem and also the batch can be changed if you successfully solve the problem. At first, everyone got excited and thought of it a cakewalk but when they set down to solve the problem they realized that Jeetu Bhaiya has given very large inputs. Vaibhav and Meena want to change the Batch and also get the chocolate. But they are unable to solve the problem for big inputs. They are ready to offer you Kachoris, if you can help them get the correct answer. Can you help them for Kachoris ?
